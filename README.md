# Predicting_total_time
Find the best model to predict time needed to complete a food order request (in seconds). In this project I have tried linear and nonlinear models with gradsearch approach: Ridge, Lasso, and MLP models. The best performance model is the MLP model. The averaged trainning error for the MLP model is around 11 minutes (657 seconds).
